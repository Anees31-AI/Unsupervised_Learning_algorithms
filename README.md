# 🍷 Unsupervised Learning on the Wine Dataset

This project explores the application of various unsupervised learning algorithms on the classic Wine dataset from scikit-learn. The goal is to understand how different algorithms cluster and visualize the data without using the true labels.

## 📈 Algorithms Implemented

- **K-Means Clustering**  
- **Hierarchical Clustering**  
- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Clustering)**  
- **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**  
- **t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)**

## 🧪 Dataset

The Wine dataset contains 13 chemical properties for 3 different wine cultivars.

## 🔍 Key Steps

✅ Data exploration and cleaning  
✅ Clustering with K-Means, Hierarchical, and DBSCAN  
✅ Evaluation using metrics like Adjusted Rand Index and Silhouette Score  
✅ Visualizing high-dimensional data using PCA and t-SNE  
✅ Tuning DBSCAN parameters for better clustering performance  

## 📊 Visualizations

- Cluster scatter plots  
- Hierarchical dendrogram  
- PCA and t-SNE 2D visualizations  
- Confusion matrices to compare cluster vs true labels
